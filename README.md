# App-Prototype-for-Eye-Tracker
A really hackish implemented app prototype for eye tracker testing.

# Features
- Reloads page on every interaction.
- Scales more or less with screensize so that no set-up is required at the testing PC.
- Persists at least some state to give a more authentic feeling.
